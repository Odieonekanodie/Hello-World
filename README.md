# Hello-World
For class

Hiya, I'm Ben! This is my github account, and as you can see, I've already made a couple of things. Both are related to front end development using html. The links repository was made as as a joke for a friend. The other repository is a website that I made for a public economics class, with the hopes that I'd get exempt from the final and so I could get more experience. Both of these were successful. Anyways, there's my little ramble. Have a good one!
